## Hey, I'm Ahmad 👋

I'm a software engineer based in Pakistan, currently building learning management systems and exploring the intersection of AI and developer productivity.

## What I Do

By day, I work on **Django/React/PostgreSQL** stacks, wrestle with Azure DevOps pipelines, and optimize database queries. By night, I experiment with local LLMs, build tools that make my workflow faster, and occasionally write about what I learn.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is my public notebook. I write about:

- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for problems I've solved
- **Tools & Workflow**: Things that make development better
- **Architecture**: Decisions, trade-offs, and lessons learned
- **TIL**: Quick notes on things I learned today

## My Setup

- **Hardware**: MacBook Pro M4 Max, 128GB RAM
- **Stack**: Django, React, PostgreSQL, Docker
- **Editor**: VS Code with Vim bindings
- **Theme**: [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com) everywhere
